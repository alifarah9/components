# v4.3.5
## Parse MoneyInput inputs as positive numbers

Since you're entering money, you can't enter negative numbers. When you enter a negative amount now, it'll be parsed as positive.

# v4.3.4

Currency options now show the flag in every device size and keyboard focused options have the same style as hovered elements, rather than active ones.

# v4.3.3
## Make money input not have decimals for integer amounts

Changes formatting of money input so that when no decimals are provided, it shows an integer amount when formatting. If a user inputs decimals, we format with the currency's decimals.

# v4.3.2

# v4.3.0
## Add money component

# v4.2.1
## Allow adding custom action label and Select elemnt props as node

This is necessary for translations

# v4.2.0
## Allow adding custom action to the end of MoneyInput options

# v4.1.2
## Change internal popover markup

Previously, popover created a container element for the trigger passed as a child and the popover itself, and overrode styles to make the popover itself not be styled like the container that acted as a trigger.

Now, popover decorates the trigger passed as a child with accessibility props and an event handler, removing the need for a wrapper element and custom styles.

This also enables focus style support out of the box.

# v4.1.1
## Make popover title accept React elements as type

This is necessary when we pass in translated strings using `retranslate` `Message` component.

# v4.1.0

- The caveat is bundle size increased from ~13 Kb to ~19Kb.

# v2.0.3

Stepper tooltips max width now 100%. In sm and md screens the first and last tooltips are moved so they won't go offscreen.
